# learning-html5
Repo for anything I do whilst learning HTML5. Feel free to take anything I upload here and play around with it!

Some of these files were made thanks to the help of Chris Courses HTML5 canvas tutorial series, which you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO6OkltgudE&list=PLpPnRKq7eNW3We9VdCfx9fprhqXHwTPXL)
